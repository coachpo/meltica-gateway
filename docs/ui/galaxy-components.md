# Galaxy Component Adoption Checklist

| Area | Component | Source | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Outbox mobile list | Card/list hybrid inspired by Galaxy `Cards/Na3ar-17_terrible-gecko-91` | Context7 `/uiverse-io/galaxy` | ✅ | Applied to `src/app/outbox/page.tsx` for ≤sm breakpoints (data-slot `table-card-row`). |
| Checkbox | Gradient checkbox based on Galaxy `Checkboxes/mrhyddenn_slippery-pug-63` | Context7 `/uiverse-io/galaxy` | ⏳ | Pending rollout across filters/forms. |

Add new rows as additional Galaxy-sourced UI patterns land in the Next.js client.
